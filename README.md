# Sneaker E-commerce App

This project was built to showcase proficiency in creating React-Redux apps as learned in the 3rd Phase of DigitalCraft's Houston bootcamp.

## Purpose

I chose to build an e-commerce app for this React-Redux project because I wanted to practice building something with a real-world purpose that I would use again in my development career. While the project was only created using front-end code, it was actually a starting point and base for another app that I built: [thePlug - App](https://github.com/gr8white/thePlug-App). 


## Technologies

These are the technologies used to build this app:

* [React](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io) - An open source CSS framework based on Flexbox
* [Adobe Comp CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/comp.html) - Layout development tool


## Deployment

A live demo has been deployed at [here](https://gr8white.github.io/thePlug/). In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console


## Process

I started drawing the design ideas for [thePlug - App](https://github.com/gr8white/thePlug-App) using the [Adobe Comp CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/comp.html). Below is the first designs for this project:

### Final Comments

Overall, I believe that this porject accomplished the goal that I set out to accomplish: understanding how React-Redux can be used to build a real world applications in a fast and organized way. Redux was a slight challenge at certain parts but with this project and more practice I think that I'll continue to sharpen my skills and build more difficult projects in the future.
